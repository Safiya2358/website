        <h3>_ _ _</h3>
        <p class="mt-5">

          nodal centre in the National Institute of Technology Durgapur for
          liaison with REC/NIT Durgapur alumni all across the globe, initiating

        <h3>_ _ _</h3>
        <p class="mt-5">
          It is our alumni whose significant contribution to the society has
          made our National Institute of Technology Durgapur (formerly, Regional
          Engineering College Durgapur) an institute of glory. Being a part of
          this glorious Institute, it becomes one of our prime duties to instil
          the essence of brotherhood into the minds of the alumni and their
          siblings from Alma-mater. We achieve this through the establishment of
          The NIT Durgapur Students Alumni Interaction (SAI) Cell. The SAI Cell
          is a group of students who voluntarily assist the functioning of the
          Centre for Alumni Affairs & International Relations (CAAIR). We are
          under the endorsement of the Dean (Alumni Affairs and Outreach).
          Having completely dedicated to nurturing the bond between students and
          alumni, the SAI Cell has become an indispensable part of the CAAIR and
          thus acting as a common platform for networking and interaction. We
          extend our hands towards our alumni and help them reconnect to their
          Alma- mater. Through regular interactions with the students, the
          alumni get a chance to share their valuable experiences and impart the
          knowledge they have acquired to the next generation of NITDIANs. Also,
          with this interchange, they get a glimpse of the young minds of the
          nation. We play an instrumental role in organising the Eminent Alumni
          Lecture, Student-Alumni Interaction in the campus,
          Industry-Institute-Interaction Program, Grand Alumni Homecoming,
          various other reunions and publication of the Annual Yearbook.
          However, we look forward to offering greater assistance to both our
          institute and alumni through innovative programs in a brighter future.
          With the aim of mending the broken link between students and alumni,
          the Alumni Cell launched the Alumni-Student Mentorship Program with
          the belief that close interaction with alumni will help students
          gather invaluable advice regarding overall development and will also
          aid them in taking crucial informative life-changing decisions. We
          feel their valuable experience would really enrich younger minds. Our
          team was formed with the aim to involve the students in the Alumni
          Activities from the student- hood itself. The team is to promote the
          interests of and understanding between the students of the past,
          present, and future NIT Durgapur through the programs and services
          offered by the organization. The objective is to educate the general
          students with a better understanding of the NIT Durgapur Alumni
          Network and likewise bring the alumni community up to date with the
          current student body. Being students ourselves, we exactly know the
          flavour of being a NITDIAN and through various interactions, we assist
          students in having a better communication with the alumni. We help the
          students in sharing their college life experiences with the alumni
          which resonate with their experiences giving them a greater nostalgic
          effect. We form a part of the endeavour to promote tradition and unity
          within the Institute and ultimately to preserve a lifelong connection
          for all those who pass through the portals of NIT Durgapur. The team
          also tries to develop a cordial and advanced professional relationship
          amongst the ex-students and present students helping the novices
          figure out the dubious nature of the journey outside NIT Durgapur. The
          alumni-driven initiatives for the benefit of students, assisting
          Alumni in different cities and organising NITDIAN seminar, various
          reunions and bridging the connectivity gap between the Institute and
          alumni allows SAI Cell Volunteers to get a splendid view of the
          ‘Alumni’ world. Working for the betterment of the Institute also
          motivates students to understand the values created by all
          well-wishers of NIT Durgapur. Through the efforts of SAI Cell, alumni
          of REC/NIT Durgapur are now able to actively contribute towards the
          betterment of their Alma-mater and we feel proud to be a part of the
          Centre for Alumni Affairs & International Relations and witness the
          evolution of our National Institute of Technology Durgapur.

        <h3>_ _ _</h3>
        <p class="mt-5">
          Dear Alumnus/Alumna, On behalf of Centre for Alumni Affairs &
          International relations (CAAIR), NIT Durgapur, I wish you all a very
          happy,healthy and prosperous new year! As you know, the Centre for
          Alumni Affairs & International Relations (CAAIR), established in the
          year 2018 under the guidance of our Honourable Director, is the
          coordinating centre of the Institute for liaison with REC/NIT Durgapur
          alumni all across the globe, initiating research/academic
          collaboration with universities and organizations in India and abroad
          and other outreach activities. Currently, our interactions with alumni
          are taking place on multiple dimensions. The most important point for
          us is the absolute increase in alumni footfall on campus. There is no
          particular season now for alumni visits – they happen throughout the
          year. We are delighted that they are keen to spend a day in the
          campus, interact with students and faculty, and learn about the
          progress of the Institute and how they can chip in to help. The
          “Eminent Alumni Lecture Series” is a runaway success, and we recently
          hosted the 15 th lecture. A Lecture in the name of “Professor Asoke
          Sen Memorial Lecture” has been instituted in honour of Prof. Asoke
          Kumar Sen, the Legendary and inspiring faculty of R.E.College Durgapur
          (Presently NIT Durgapur). Being associated with this esteemed
          Institute as a student, alumnus, faculty, Associate Dean (Alumni &
          Outreach) and presently as coordinator, CAAIR, has helped me to
          perceive the Institute through multi-dimensional aspects. As a result,
          the need to address dynamic requirements of the Institute and the
          strategies thereof has become immaculate. You are a part of our
          timeline, and your engagement with the Institute is crucial in helping
          us to reach our mission and vision. We have taken this approach
          following major Technical Institutes in India and abroad to increase
          our sustainable fundraising and enhance our NIRF ranking. I do
          envisage alumni playing a proactive role in successful implementation
          of the Institute diamond Jubilee year exercise including facilitating
          mentoring students & faculty, industry and academia linkages and
          participating actively in the development and overall growth of our
          beloved Alma mater. The joy of giving back during Institute Diamond
          Jubilee year is another key step in this direction and I hope you will
          actively participate and contribute towards developing sustainable
          fund raising, building NIT Durgapur brand etc. Therefore, be proud to
          be connected, and make other alumnus/Alumna proud by connecting and
          contributing generously to his/her academic temple i.e., our Alma
          mater. We would also like to acknowledge the generous contribution of
          our notable Alumnus Mr. Jyoti Prasad Bhattacharya (1982, B.E,
          Electrical Engineering) by gifting the dynamic, vibrant and responsive
          website for Centre for Alumni Affairs & International Relations
          (CAAIR). Please register through this newly developed CAAIR website or
          alumni page and avail the alumni card along with the other benefits of
          this digital platform. We look forward to a strong support from you.
          If you have any constructive idea on how we can engage with you,
          please feel free to contact us at alumni@admin.nitdgp.ac.in Let’s
          Networking (N) Involving (I) and Transforming (T)-DGP (DiGital
          Platform). Together we could do better & we should.<br>
          Sincerely,<br>
